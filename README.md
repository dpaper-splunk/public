# David Paper's Public Splunk Repository

Welcome! 

You'll find various dashboards, whitepapers and apps that I've created for customers here. Feedback is always appreciated.

## Dashboards

* [Extended Search Reporting](https://github.com/dpaper-splunk/public/blob/master/dashboards/extended_search_reporting.xml). This dashboard looks at Search load in Splunk with a different lens than Monitoring Console. Works for both Splunk Cloud and Splunk on premise. Included are 

  * Two takes on a search efficiency metric
  * Searches by frequency vs duration (easily find the search running every 5 mins that looks back 1 week)
  * Users who don't include the four default indexed fields in their search
  * Two takes on search duration, bucketing by time blocks and counts
  * Visualization of when searches are scheduled across the entire SH, per app and per user
  * Searches grouped by cron schedule type, sorted by name (easy to find searches that do almost the same thing by name and are ripe for consolidation)
  * Heavy weight dashboards that cause role search concurrency or disk and server-wide limits to be hit when loading

Note the method of including a timer for panel loading time and identifying inline SPL by search id so panels are easy to identify in audit logs via savedsearch_name.
  
* [Metrics Related to Ingestion Blockage](https://github.com/dpaper-splunk/public/blob/master/dashboards/metrics_related_to_ingestion_blockage.xml). This dashboard looks at data ingestion metrics including forwarder and indexer tiers. Designed to work with Splunk Cloud, but can be easily adapted to on prem. Included are

  * Indexer ingestion and replication queue filling indicators including data port listener availability
  * Peer replication traffic
  * Mpool buffer filling
  * Forwarders dropping events due to being unable to forward
  * Hot bucket counts

## Whitepapers

* [Disk Diagnosis: Digging Deep with Monitoring Console and More](https://github.com/dpaper-splunk/public/blob/master/whitepapers/Digging%20Deep%20into%20Disk%20Diagnoses.pdf). This whitepaper, also published at https://www.splunk.com/pdfs/technical-briefs/disk-diagnosis-digging-deep-with-monitoring-console-and-more.pdf, walks a Splunk admin through using the Monitoring Console and Linux CLI tools to closely observe disk performance to determine if a number of metrics are within an acceptable range. 

* [Splunk Upgrade Pre-, In-situ-, and Post- Validation Steps](https://github.com/dpaper-splunk/public/blob/master/whitepapers/Upgrade%20pre-%2C%20in-situ-%2C%20and%20post-%20validation%20steps.pdf). This whitepaper provides specific checklists for items to review before, during and after Splunk Enterprise core upgrades to pave the way for a smooth upgrade. It does not provide specific upgrade procedures which will be customized to the environment, but takes a more holistic approach to answer the questions of "Am I good to go for an upgrade? How do I know an upgrade went successfully? What should I look for to compare before and after my upgrade?"

* [Splunk Scheduled Search Management](https://github.com/dpaper-splunk/public/blob/master/whitepapers/Splunk%20Scheduled%20Search%20Management.pdf). If you have a busy Splunk environment, then you will want to know how to manage your scheduled searches. To do so requires understanding how Splunk prioritizes and schedules searches, what happens when things don't work the way they are expected to, and what to do about them. This paper introduces some new visuals for managing scheduled search scheduling and provides solutions for better utilizing the capacity of the deployment.

## Apps

* [Index Usage Reporting](https://github.com/dpaper-splunk/public/tree/master/apps/IUR). This app for enabled Splunk administrators to determine which indexes are searches and which ones aren't, beyond what is available in the auditing logs for Splunk. Use this app to raise the signal to noise ratio of valuable data in your Splunk Enterprise environment.
